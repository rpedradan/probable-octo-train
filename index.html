  <h2>Tubbataha Reef, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located at the heart of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a haven not just for divers but marine conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan.

  <h2>Kawasan Falls, Cebu</h2>
  <p>
    If you like jumping into or swimming in cool cascading waters, Kawasan Falls in Cebu hits the sweet spot. It is a multi-layered waterfall in the town of Badian and is best known for its turquoise waters. With a height of 40 meters, the first cascade, or level, is where most visitors stay, swim, and enjoy a natural water massage on board a bamboo raft. A 10-minute trek takes you up to the quieter second cascade.

  <h2>Kayangan Lake, Coron, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Kayangan Lake tours will take you to the jagged limestone cliffs and islets surrounding the lake. All these add up to a dramatic landscape, best seen from a 10-minute climb up a hill. Curiously, this view is not of the actual Kayangan Lake but the area where the tour boats park, but it is still breathtaking nonetheless.

  <h2>Cloud 9, Siargao</h2>
  <p>
    Siargao’s rise as a top tourist spot in the Philippines is nothing short of meteoric. Once a sleepy island in Surigao del Norte, it has become one of the favorite destinations and playgrounds for travelers, and it is primarily because of one activity: surfing. It is now known as the Philippines' surfing capital, and some even regard it as the surfing mecca of Asia

  <h2>White Beach, Boracay</h2>
  <p>
    Long hailed as one of the best beaches in the entire world, Boracay’s claim to fame is its 4-kilometer stretch of pure white, powdery sand called White Beach. Cliche as it sounds, White Beach is truly postcard-perfect, with tall coconut trees lined up and crystal-clear calm waters rounding up its unmatched beauty, making it the top attraction in Boracay trips.
